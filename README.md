## Short description

### What's the problem?

Using the dataset containing sales prices of cars, eprocess and prepare the data to apply the machine learning knowledge studied in Book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. This will include creating, analysing and generating predictions with regression models.

## Train, fit and test the model
In order to analyze the data, we have to preprocess it in order to prepare it for Machine Learning algorithms. 

Machine Learning workflow:

a) Import relevant libraries
b) Step 2: Import dataset 
c) Step 3: Divide data into train and test 
d) Step 4: Data Exploration 
e) Step 5: Scale and normalize the data
f) Step 6: Design the right model 
g) Step 7: Train the model on our dataset
h) Step 8: Test the model
